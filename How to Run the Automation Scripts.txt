How to Run the Automation Scripts
Prerequisites
Install Node.js (v16+)

(Optional) Install Git

Get the repo

Clone: git clone https://github.com/trackon-software/tradingdocs-e2e

Or download ZIP and extract

cd your-repo-name

Install dependencies

bash (I ran these on vscode terminal)

npm install
npx playwright install

Configure environment variables
Create .env because login info is on an env file 

How To Run tests

npx playwright test --reporter=list --headed
this command executed from terminal returns the console logs and runs the website so you can clearly see the steps taken while testing. --reporter=list returns the logs and --headed runs the website.
